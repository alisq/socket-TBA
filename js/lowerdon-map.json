Almost everybody whoa, whoa,... we've come a way. Yeah! Honestly, I was in a group the other week, literally no one had ever heard of it. So, this is refreshing. We acknowledge Toronto as a gathering place for many people of Turtle Island who recognize the long history of First Nations people in Ontario and show respect today to the ones that return the city and back the Mississauga's of the credits and the Chippewa—also transplants of trying to get rid of that big echo of what's going on. The territory was a subject with a dish with one spoon wampum belt covenant's agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and the Ojibwe and allied nations to peaceably care for and share the resources around the Great Lakes. This territory is also covered by the Upper Canada treaties.</p>
    <p>Who's heard of the dish with one spoon? Wow. What I usually say here, especially if there are lots of immigrants in the group, which would include me, is that when you become a Canadian citizen, it's important to know that you've actually signed on to the treaties and that we all become treaty people as we become Canadian citizens and sign on to the duty of caring for and sharing the land. Today, Toronto is home to many indigenous people from across Turtle Island or North America, and we are grateful to be here. Chi-miigwech.” (Helen Mills)</p>

            “let’s stand where trees stood in the water<br />
              where Toronto can be a word for how to catch fish<br />
                where salmon find a place to lay their eggs<br />
               where the cries of birds can still awaken the unknown in all of us<br />
            where we can be grateful for the changing course of the river<br />
       where we don’t right the river 	the river writes us<br />
    let’s linger where we can learn about time by standing by a river<br />
        let’s praise the watercourse not bury it”

    “At sunrise that autumn day we hired the ruined<br />
    Civil War veteran to row us from the present to the past,<br />
    across the Don River where the Queen Street bridge<br />
    was washed out in the 1930s. Charon, we called him<br />
    behind his back, though he was just taking us to<br />
    another life. He and Ruth and I at first light, floating<br />
    into that other atmosphere, the outer realm of morning<br />
    waiting in the east. A kingfisher lighted on one of his oars,<br />
    a flock of Monarchs pursued us from the Joe Pye weed<br />
    on the banks. The journey so much longer than we expected.<br />
    Fall has arrived with quick blue skies. Such were our skies<br />
    that September dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mid-morning our oarsman pulled up on one of the five<br />
    islands no longer in the river—dynamited out by men<br />
    who carried boxes of explosives, one by one, downhill.<br />
    The island that skaters used to rest on in winter.”

    “Do not dress like a man―slouching hat<br />
    & waders―unless you want to be asked to share  <br />
    <br />
    a beer. Do not question a gentleman’s technique―<br />
    how to cast, reel in, humanely kill.  <br />
    <br />
    Sensitive women need not witness the scaling<br />
    & gutting. Or hear about your quick-fry<br />
    <br />
    method. It only sickens them.  The river pike<br />
    bite, steal hair clips, wedding rings.<br />
    <br />
    Refrain from looking into their eyes.<br />
    It only encourages them.”

    Note: This poem was inspired by an archival photo (1908) of three women river-fishing (see City of Toronto Archives, Fond 1244, Item 167A). The narrator (fictional) is a Toronto public health nurse in the early 1900s; she appears in several other poems in my Don River series.

     “I don’t know what to tell you<br />
    about life along the Don. It troubles me<br />
    to imagine its wild, abundant, free-<br />
    flowing past, and how the forms of survival<br />
    I was taught to practice have left it<br />
    like a dirty, sodden rag. The year I was 22<br />
    I crossed it twice a day, sometimes more,<br />
    by bicycle, subway, streetcar. On foot,<br />
    a friend at my side. We were<br />
    cub reporters, I’d taken a call, heard<br />
    news meant only for me. He unpeeled<br />
    me from my desk to walk me home.<br />
    I might have looked down as we crossed,<br />
    vaguely noted the familiar, brown trickle<br />
    in its trench. I didn’t think of the Don<br />
    as a waterway, a succession of histories,<br />
    an altered form. The valley was<br />
    forbidding, unknowable; to live on <br />
    its eastern flank was to score<br />
    an arresting view. That morning<br />
    I crossed the river one kind of person;<br />
    I returned used-up, hollow, littered<br />
    with debris, dismal as the Don<br />
    but still moving, this way<br />
    and that, without<br />
    apparent design, braced<br />
    for my own Improvement Plan. I was due<br />
    to be channelled and dredged.”

    “Be the river then, straight or crooked, <br />
    its hidden energy pulling it ever down <br />

    its red clay trough, be the way it wears <br />
    its own being-in-motion into place there, <br />
    the polished and runnelled banks which <br />
    curve and hold, be both flow and bank <br />

    which pushes against its surface smoothing <br />
    or ruffing, snatching for something.”
